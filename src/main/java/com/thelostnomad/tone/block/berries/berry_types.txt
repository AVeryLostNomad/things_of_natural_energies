* General Tree Functions *
**************************

[IB] Hastoberries - As a block, speeds tickrate of sentient trees.
               As an item (break w/o shears) gives speed 2 for 30 seconds on consumption.
               TODO As a potion/pool (brewed through seeping alchemy), gives speed 1 for 5 minutes or 3 for 1 minute.
               Grow in a desert to have a chance at getting a hasto berry. (2% per leaf in desert/desert hills)
Luxoberries -  As a block, gives a chance to double (also, separately, odds to triple) an ore item on FIRST pull into the system. High life/tick cost
               As an item (break w/o shears) gives silk touch for 30 seconds.
               TODO As a potion/pool (brewed through seeping alchemy), gives silk touch for 5 minutes or imbues an item with silk touch
               Grow in the end to have a chance at getting a luxoberry. (0.5% per leaf in end biome)
Lumoberries -  As a block, makes the tree light up the local area by periodically spawning a torch.
               As an item (break w/o shears) gives night vision for 30 seconds.
               TODO as a potion/pool (brewed through seeping alchemy), gives night vision for 5 minutes or (as a pool) can be used as liquid fuel for the day engine <multiblock pending. Sets it to perpetual day>
               Grow in a dark oak forest to get these.
[IB]Glutoberries - As a block, makes the tree consume food tossed on the ground near a root block as a substitute for life. More glutoberries = more life
               As an item (break w/o shears) gives full saturation, instantly.
               TODO as a potion/pool (brewed through seeping alchemy), gives never hungry for 5 minutes or (as a pool) negates hunger drain entirely.
               Grow in any biome containing "Taiga" to obtain
Voroberry -    As a block, makes the tree consume literally every ounce of life given to it, instead of the default (to the lowest point)
               This means that farmland will not be reduced to the lowest growth level, but instead completely devoured.
               Animals will not be left with one hp, but rather killed outright. Drops will be *CONVERTED TO EXTRA LIFE*
               instead of dropped like a mobfarm. (Noxicberries are for that functionality)
               You need one voroberry per root block on your tree, otherwise the outer few won't be affected.
               As an item, gives increased saturation and hunger refil on food items for 5 minutes
               A tree will immediately suck up this essence if put into a seeping alchemy process, so it is not possible to make the pool form.
               Grow in the nether to have a chance at this item. (Again, low chance)
[IB] Funcoberry -   Makes the tree draw one more item at a time. (From multiple stacks, that is)
               27 funcoberries will have the tree draw simultaneously from all stacks in a chest. Can be extended to other inventories.
               Adds a multiplier on the cost for each action, so with one funcoberry, each action (pulling two items, for example, will cost double (400 instead of 200))
               Three berries = (600 instead of 200) because it pulls three items, etc...

*****************************
* Autocrafting with berries *
*****************************

Recoberry -    Complement to craftoberry, will allow for you to specify recipes that override the base level ones. A
               craftoberry can only see the most basic of recipes for any given crafting operation (the first one to be defined)
               but this berry can define an override that will always be seen first and will always be tried first)
               One needed per recipe you wish to override
               Any time a recoberry is used in crafting, ten thousand life is deducted immediately - per use.
Craftoberry -  Special type of berry.
               These are required for your tree to do any sort of autocrafting. Unfortunately, they are rather primitive.
               Craftoberries must be allocated based on the complexity of your desired autocraft.
               For example, let's say that I want to have my tree make enchantment tables (vanilla ones) but I don't have
               them in my system. I do, however, have a ton of sugar canes in there, obsidian, and even diamond blocks.
               Can I craft it? Sure, but it has a certain complexity value that corresponds to the number of craftoberries needed
               to do the operation. By default, this number grows really, really fast with more complex crafts
               (14 required for the enchantment table, 15 if you have only diamond blocks)
               Life is also charged at a ridiculous amount proportional to the number of craftoberries involved (complexity).
Deductoberries-Deduct all life cost, universally, per operation. Extra benefit on crafting operations, though.
               Each deductoberry will lessen cost by ten percent, down to a minimum of 50% discount on crafting operations and
               25% discount on other operations. These grow only in mooshroom biomes, also.
Simploberries- Each simploberry counts as two tenths of a point of automatic complexity deduction. Twenty simploberries means - 10 complexity,
               which could really help cost and number of craftoberries needed. Sixty would be - 30 complexity, which is enough to render many crafting recipes
               "free" in that they have zero complexity. (NOTE: Autocrafting still does require at least one craftoberry to be present, but a craft of zero
               complexity will not incur a life cost).
